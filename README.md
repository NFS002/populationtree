# AssessingTheGenerationalContract

This is a data visualisation I completed project for Imperial College, London. My task was to create some data visuaisations that
illustrated the relationship and distribution of wealth in successive generations. `they key idea being that the next generation
will have a larger social care bill and generall more expenditures than the previous ones. It is not necessarilly true that
they will have less income though, but sunce people are generally living longer as time goes on, the old age dependency ratio
is always increasing. One way govermental policy is trying to combat this is by raisin the state retirement age gradually.

The first of these visualisations is an animated population tree. Credit to Mike Bostock https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4062085
for providing the inspiration. The data used was collected from the ESRC (Economic social research council) 

The second shows show the distribution of remaining lifetime resources and uses for each generation. For example, the average new born 
(0-9 year olds) expects to receive £675k in wages (human capital), 
£258k in welfare, state education and health benefits, £168k in private transfers (such as from parents), £61k  
in net inheritances over their remaining lifetime but has no current financial assets.  They will spend these resources over 
their lifetime; £677k  on private consumption, £166k on public consumption such as on education and health, £216k on taxes, £107k on
their children (all values are calculated as present values with an interest rate of 5%). 

The third outlines the size of the total wealth in £K for each of the age groups.

All visualtions were completed using javascript, the first two using D3.js, and the third using google visualisations. All three can also be found on the imperial college website at https://www.imperial.ac.uk/business-school/research/finance/our-research/assessing-the-generational-contract/project-research/
All pages in the /assessing-the-generational-contract directory/* were also completed by me.
